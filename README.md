# Computational Thinking for AI

This repo. contains the course materials for a 6-week introductory machine learning master's courses that covers the foundational concepts and tools needed for research of this field. The weekly structure of the course is as follows:

## Week
### 1. Introduction to:
- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
- Scientific Python

### 2. Mathematical Foundations: Linear Algebra

### 3. Mathematical Foundattions: Probability

### 4. Machine Learning's Bread and Butter:
- Optimization
  - Mathematics for ML: Chapter 7, Continuous Optimization
- Automatic differentiation (AD)
  - Book: "Automatic Differentiation: Applications, Theory, and Implementations" published in 2006 by Springer
    - Article 1: "Backwards Differentiation in AD and Neural Nets: Past Links and New Opportunities" by Paul Werbos, in book
    - Article 2: by Louis Rall, "Perspectives on Automatic Differentiation: Past, Present, and Future?", good history of AD.
