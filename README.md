# Computational Thinking for AI

This repo. contains the course materials for a 6-week introductory machine learning master's courses that covers the foundational concepts and tools needed for research of this field. The weekly structure of the course is as follows:

## Week
1. Introduction to:
- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
- Scientific Python

2. Mathematical Foundations: Linear Algebra

3. Mathematical Foundattions: Probability

4. Machine Learning's Bread and Butter:
- Optimization
  - 
- Automatic differentiation (AD)
  - The best I found was an article titled, "Backwards Differentiation in AD and Neural Nets: Past Links and New Opportunities" by Paul Werbos, which can be found in the book "Automatic Differentiation: Applications, Theory, and Implementations" published in 2006 by Springer. That article is preceded by one written by Louis Rall titled, "Perspectives on Automatic Differentiation: Past, Present, and Future?", which also provides some good history of AD.
  

5. Algorithm analysis

6A. Data manipulation and visualization

6B. Large scale experimentation
